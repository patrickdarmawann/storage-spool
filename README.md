3D Printed Container using eSun filament spool

Summary

Hi, I'm Patrick and this is my very first thing on Thingiverse. This is a storage system solution for those who used the eSun Filament, especially the clear spool one. I have a lot of these laying around and want to make use of them. At first, I made the 3D model of the spool using Fusion 360, and then made the storage accordingly. There’s some part of these storage solution including :
Drawers
The drawers were designed to be stuck together using rubber bands, hence the hook at the bottom. If one needs more pressure to stick the drawers together, more rubber bands can be used, or just a lace or rope and tie it accordingly.
Joiner
The joiner was designed to stack the spool (recommended up to 10 stacks), using thread to join to another joiner. It was made with male and female thread so it can be stacked.
Base
The base was designed just to be the base of the screw part.


Design Process
I want a storage system solution that : 
Can incorporate my spool (because i had a lot of them)
To address the first goal, I made the 3D model of the eSun spool to be used as a guidance. After that was finished, I made the screw part and the base. This took around 6hrs and some printing to test the thread.
No drilling required (hence needed another solution)
I want that so no drilling is required to make this storage, so I planned on using a rubber band to attach the drawers together. Rubber bands are cheap in my country (Indonesia) so I decided to use it for this storage solution.
Not filament-costly
This is an important goal to achieve because we don’t want to waste a lot of filament just to reuse the filament spool. The drawer has a 0.5mm floor thickness and 0.7mm wall thickness, which is thin. The joiner was made a little thick to support stacking the spool, and generally it’s less filament costly than the drawers. The base also was made a little thick to support the weight of the stacks.


Printing
This is just some consideration of printing settings. All parts can be printed at 0.4mm layer height, no supports and rafts required. Infill should be 5-15%, and can’t be 0%. Perimeter should be 2 or more.
Drawers
The floor of the drawers should have 2 layers, you can do this by lowering your layer height, or just lowering the first layer height. 1 layer is fine, but I prefer 2 layers. The drawers can be printed at 0.4mm with no problem.
The hook needs to do a bridging, so make sure your settings and printer can handle the bridge. Even though you haven’t calibrated your settings and printer, the bridge itself is just around 4-5mm, so most of the time you don’t have to worry about it.
Joiner
It’s a good practice to have a small layer height (0.1-0.2 mm) to print thread, but I want my parts to be faster to print, so the thread was made bigger and capable to be printed at 0.4mm. The bottom part of the thread is chamfered at 45 degree angle, and the top part is filleted, so no bridging to worry about.
Base
The base can just be printed as is, i recommend to print this at 0.4mm just to be fast. The base is just a thread and large footings to accommodate the weight of the spools. The large footprints are useful to distribute the weight of the spool, but at the same time it was made hollow to lower the filament consumption.

The Ender 3 I used to print these parts is a modified Ender 3 with 0.5mm nozzle and modded with a direct drive system, so it’s easy to print at 0.4mm. If your printer is not capable of 0.4mm layer height, please use any layer height that’s suitable for you and the printer. The difference in usefulness with lower or higher layer height is negligible, although higher layer height (0.4mm or more) is faster to print.

Files
There is 6 files in total :
A_2div
B_2div
A_3div
B_3div
Joiner
Base
A and B denote the drawers that were designed in pairs. The div means the number of divisions inside the drawer. The division is equal size. 
All parts can be printed with 0.4mm layer height or less. (tested at 0.4mm)
